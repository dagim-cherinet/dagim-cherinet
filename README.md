## About me
I graduated from Hawassa University in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Stream. My educational background helped me to understand the underlying internal working principles and architecture of computers and this helps me to write efficient programs. I have passion towards software development because of this, beside my formal education I always try to learn and update my skillsets. 

I can develop full-stack web-applications using the following technologies
- 1. Front-end:- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
- 2. Back-end:- Node.js, Express.js
- 3. Database:- both relational and non-relational databases (MySQL, SQL, MongoDB)

## Currently
Currently beside building full-stack web-apps I'm also learning and solving different Data Structure and Algorithm problems using Java
